### BREAKING CHANGES

* rework of the ids, we now use the in-game ids instead of the DB ones. Which mean:

- all global-only units have their ids updated to match those of the game
- Glo-first units which have been released later on Japan version are now displayed along-side their japan counter-side
- ids in the OPTC-BM export format are not compatible with DB-ids anymore (they are those of the game) NB: this doesn't affect "Export For" feature
